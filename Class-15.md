# Intro to Machine Learning 

Machine learning is the practice of teaching computers how to learn patterns from data, often for making decisions or predictions.

For true machine learning, the computer must be able to learn patterns that it's not explicitly programmed to identify.

## Key Terminology 
* Model - a set of patterns learned from data.

* Algorithm - a specific ML process used to train a model.

* Training data - the dataset from which the algorithm * learns the model.
* Test data - a new dataset for reliably evaluating model performance.
* Features - Variables (columns) in the dataset used to  train the model.

* Target variable - A specific variable you're trying to predict.
* Observations - Data points (rows) in the dataset.

## Machine Learning Tasks
A task is a specific objective for your algorithms.
Algorithms can be swapped in and out, as long as you pick the right task.
In fact, you should always try multiple algorithms because you most likely won't know which one will perform best for your dataset.

there is two kinds of tasks:

1. supervised larning:
supervised learning has tasks for labeled data 
its like an advanced form of predictive modeling,each observation must be labeled with a correct answer so you can build a predictive model,because you must tell the algorythem whats correct while training it "supervising"

2. unsupervised learning: 
the tasks are for unlabeled data,its often used either like an automated data analysis or automated signal extraction, this kind of data dont have a correct answer so your letting the algothm directly learn patterns from the data "without supervision"

## The 3 Elements of Great Machine Learning
1. A skilled chef (human guidance):
> even though we are "teaching computers to learn on their own," human guidance plays a huge role.
2. Fresh ingredients (clean, relevant data):
>Professional data scientists spend most their time understanding the data, cleaning it, and engineering new features.
3. Don't overcook it (avoid overfitting):
> One of the most dangerous pitfalls in machine learning is overfitting. An overfit model has "memorized" the noise in the training set, instead of learning the true underlying patterns.
