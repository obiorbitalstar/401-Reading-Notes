# BIG O notaion 

In simple terms big o can be explained as how time scales with respect to some input variables 

Lets use a small story to explain some of it. 

In 2009 there was this african company that had slow internet connection, So they wanted to make a fun test 
they put the data they wanted to move in a usb drive and tied it to a pigeon, It was a race between a pigeon and the internet, ofc the pigeon won or this wouldnt have been covered by the news, Personally i think this comparison is a little unrealistic or unfair becuase the amount of data dosnt matter for the pigeon , It just have to cross the same distance regaless of the size of data put in the usb while for the internet the size of data matters, So how can we change this story in relation to big o? 
We are gonna cut it into expamples with explonations 

## O(1)

O(1) describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set. 
So O(1) is the peigun in out story , regarldess of the size of data put in the usb it will need the same amount of time to go from point A to point B  
so o(1) deals with constant time or constant inputs 

## O(N)

O(N) describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set.
O(N) is the internet in our story , The amout of data u want to send effect the time needed to upload it, 
so O(N) deals with linear time and is effected by the input 

## O($n^2$)
O($N^2$) represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set.
I dont know how to apply this on our pigeon story so lets try a diffrent one.
Let's say you're making dinner for your family. O is the process of following a recipe, and n is the number of times you follow a recipe 
O($n^2$) would be you makeing individual dishes redundantly for every person. You follow all recipes for each person in your family (recipe times the number of people squared).
