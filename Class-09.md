# Stacks and Queues

## Stack 
A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

* FILO
First In Last Out

This means that the first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack.

* LIFO
Last In First Out

This means that the last item added to the stack will be the first item popped out of the stack.

### Push O(1)
Pushing a Node onto a stack will always be an O(1) operation. This is because it takes the same amount of time no matter how many Nodes (n) you have in the stack.

When adding a Node, you push it into the stack by assigning it as the new top, with its next property equal to the original top. 

 ``` 

Pseudo code to push a value onto a stack:

ALOGORITHM push(value)
// INPUT <-- value to add, wrapped in Node internally
// OUTPUT <-- none
   node = new Node(value)
   node.next <-- Top
   top <-- Node

 ```

### Pop O(1)
Popping a Node off a stack is the action of removing a Node from the top. When conducting a pop, the top Node will be re-assigned to the Node that lives below and the top Node is returned to the user.

Typically, you would check isEmpty before conducting a pop. This will ensure that an exception is not raised. Alternately, you can wrap the call in a try/catch block.

* Pseudocode for a pop

  ```
  ALGORITHM pop()
// INPUT <-- No input
// OUTPUT <-- value of top Node in stack
// EXCEPTION if stack is empty

   Node temp <-- top
   top <-- top.next
   temp.next <-- null
   return temp.value 
    ``` 
  
### Peek O(1)
When conducting a peek, you will only be inspecting the top Node of the stack.

Typically, you would check isEmpty before conducting a peek. This will ensure that an exception is not raised. Alternately, you can wrap the call in a try/catch block.
* Pseudocode for a peek

 ```
 ALGORITHM peek()
// INPUT <-- none
// OUTPUT <-- value of top Node in stack
// EXCEPTION if stack is empty

   return top.value
   ```
### IsEmpty O(1)
* pseudocode for isEmpty
 ``` 
 
ALGORITHM isEmpty()
// INPUT <-- none
// OUTPUT <-- boolean

return top = NULL

 ```

# Queue
Queue is an abstract data structure, somewhat similar to Stacks. Unlike stacks, a queue is open at both its ends. One end is always used to insert data (enqueue) and the other is used to remove data (dequeue). Queue follows First-In-First-Out methodology

* FIFO
First In First Out

This means that the first item in the queue will be the first item out of the queue.

### Enqueue O(1)
When you add an item to a queue, you use the enqueue action. This is done with an O(1) operation in time because it does not matter how many other items live in the queue (n); it takes the same amount of time to perform the operation.

* Pseudocode for the enqueue method:
 ``` ALGORITHM enqueue(value)
// INPUT <-- value to add to queue (will be wrapped in Node internally)
// OUTPUT <-- none
   node = new Node(value)
   rear.next <-- node
   rear <-- node
   ``` 
   
### Dequeue O(1)
When you remove an item from a queue, you use the dequeue action. This is done with an O(1) operation in time because it doesnâ€™t matter how many other items are in the queue, you are always just removing the front Node of the queue.

Typically, you would check isEmpty before conducting a dequeue. This will ensure that an exception is not raised. Alternately, you can wrap the call in a try/catch block.

* pseudocode for the dequeue method:

 ```
  ALGORITHM dequeue()
// INPUT <-- none
// OUTPUT <-- value of the removed Node
// EXCEPTION if queue is empty

   Node temp <-- front
   front <-- front.next
   temp.next <-- null

   return temp.value 
   ```
### Peek O(1)
When conducting a peek, you will only be inspecting the front Node of the queue.

Typically, you want to check isEmpty before conducting a peek. This will ensure that an exception is not raised. Alternately, you can wrap the call in a try/catch block.

* pseudocode for a peek

  ``` 
    ALGORITHM peek()
    // INPUT <-- none
    // OUTPUT <-- value of the front Node in Queue
    // EXCEPTION if Queue is empty

    return front.value
    
  ``` 

### IsEmpty O(1)
Here is the pseudocode for isEmpty

  ``` 
  ALGORITHM isEmpty()
// INPUT <-- none
// OUTPUT <-- boolean

return front = NULL
